For this project I am starting with my own [React boilerplate](https://github.com/JacobParis/react-boilerplate) as a launching point. It's pretty basic, but saves me a lot of time dealing with fundamentals instead of product development.

From this point, we're starting off with a basic React app, using a React-Router for navigation and one single Scene called Home. 

The UI will be built with components stolen from my [UI Library](https://jacobparis.com/ui/) which is an ongoing project to create a reusable set of components ready to drop into React projects. 

For drafting UI designs, I use my [Blackboard](https://writeonblackboard.com/) which I shill so often that if they offered an affiliate program I'd be retired already. I sketched out some UI concepts earlier and the only UI component I wanted that I didn't already have made was **Tabs**, which I took the liberty of coding earlier today before beginning this project. Is that cheating? My lawyer won't answer my calls anymore, so I'm afraid we'll never know.

In the Wizard of Oz, the lead character Dorothy's dog is named Toto and you can't spell the tornado that swept her to Oz without todo either. Puns are my friends.
